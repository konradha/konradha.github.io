Hi. I'm Konrad, Masters student at [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en). I write about things
that I'm currently learning or working on. Previously, I've supported compilers: 
LFortran -- _soon_ to be [compiling SciPy to WebAssembly](https://twitter.com/SylvainCorlay/status/1565345826745884672)
-- and before that, with AMD in Cologne.
Come say hi at konradha `email_symbol` yahoo.com.

I try to be comfortable in unlikely places.

Hi. I'm Konrad, Masters student at [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en). Previously, I've supported compilers: 
LFortran -- soon to be [compiling SciPy to WebAssembly](https://twitter.com/SylvainCorlay/status/1565345826745884672)
-- and before that, with AMD in Cologne.
Come say hi at konradha Ã¤t yahoo dot com.
